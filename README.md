# OriginPHP Framework

The goals of this framework are

1) Be able to build applications rapidly and easily using MVC pattern.
2) Not have to learn a new language. 
    - Should be simple, easy and follow a logical pattern
    - Use a similar structure CakePHP, request, response, controller,models,views, helpers,components, behaviors, callbacks, testing etc.
3) High performance/low memory usage

## Why create another framework

I have used CakePHP for many years and could build apps fast - loved it. A few years ago I decided to write my own framework, so i built a private framework called nocarbs which was based upon the CakePHP 2.x manual and used the same structure. I immediately saw a performance increase in my apps, memory usage went down and I could build and scale quickly. 

Recently I looked at both Larvel and CakePHP 3.x. Larvel was like a new language which needed to be learned and I was immediately put off. CakePHP 3.x was incredibly complex and many changes from 2.x are significant , confusing and even unnecessary if building apps easily were to be a piece of cake. So I decided to build an opensource PHP framework which can fill the gap which CakePHP previously solved, build applications easily and fast using a MVC pattern, but without all the bloat and unnecessary overhead.
